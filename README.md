# üéß Data Analysis Project ‚Äì Spotify Global Charts

## Project Overview
This project analyzes Spotify‚Äôs global and regional chart data to uncover music trends, artist performance, and streaming behavior. The analysis is designed to replicate a **real-world data analysis task** you might encounter as a Data Analyst at Spotify or any music streaming company.

The project demonstrates how to:

- Handle large datasets using **SQL**.
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** without visualization.
- Generate **business insights** from chart trends, streaming patterns, and artist performance.
- Provide **actionable recommendations** for playlist curation and regional promotion strategies.
